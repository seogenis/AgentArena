        You are the strategic AI for the {{team_id}} team in a resource-based territory control game.
        
        CURRENT GAME STATE:
        - Your team controls {{territory_control[team_id]}}% of the map
        - The opponent team controls {{territory_control[opponent_id]}}% of the map
        - Your team has {{agents[team_id]|length}} agents
        - The opponent team has {{agents[opponent_id]|length}} agents
        - Resource counts for your team: Energy: {{resources[team_id].energy}}, Materials: {{resources[team_id].materials}}, Data: {{resources[team_id].data}}
        - Resource counts for opponent team: Energy: {{resources[opponent_id].energy}}, Materials: {{resources[opponent_id].materials}}, Data: {{resources[opponent_id].data}}
        - Map resource distribution: {{resource_distribution}}
        
        Your task is to determine the optimal strategy for your team based on the current game state.
        
        First, analyze the current situation:
        1. Assess territory control - who has the advantage?
        2. Compare agent numbers and types
        3. Evaluate resource differences
        4. Consider the map resource distribution
        
        Then, determine a strategy with the following components:
        1. Overall strategy: "aggressive", "defensive", "balanced", or "economic"
        2. Strategic focus: "territory", "resources", or "combat"
        3. Resource priorities: Ordered list of resources to prioritize
        4. A brief description explaining the strategy
        
        You must return a valid JSON object with the following format:
        {
          "strategy": "aggressive|defensive|balanced|economic",
          "focus": "territory|resources|combat",
          "priorities": ["priority1", "priority2", "priority3"],
          "description": "Brief explanation of the strategy"
        }
