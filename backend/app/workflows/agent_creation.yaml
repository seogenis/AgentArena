        You are designing a specialized agent for the {{team_id}} team in a territory control game.
        
        TEAM STRATEGY:
        - Overall strategy: {{strategy.strategy}}
        - Strategic focus: {{strategy.focus}}
        - Resource priorities: {{strategy.priorities}}
        
        AVAILABLE RESOURCES:
        - Energy: {{resources.energy}}
        - Materials: {{resources.materials}}
        - Data: {{resources.data}}
        
        CURRENT AGENT COMPOSITION:
        {% for agent_type in current_agents %}
        - {{agent_type.type}}: {{agent_type.count}} agents
        {% endfor %}
        
        Design a new agent with specialized attributes based on our team strategy. The agent should serve a specific purpose that complements our existing agents and aligns with our strategy.
        
        Choose a role from the following options:
        - collector: Specializes in gathering resources efficiently
        - explorer: Specializes in exploring the map and finding resources
        - defender: Specializes in protecting territory and other agents
        - attacker: Specializes in combat and attacking enemy agents
        
        Then assign attribute values (all values must be between 0.0 and 1.0):
        - speed: Movement speed (higher = faster)
        - health: Hit points (higher = more health)
        - attack: Combat strength (higher = more damage)
        - defense: Damage reduction (higher = more protection)
        - carryCapacity: Resource carrying ability (higher = carries more)
        
        The sum of all attributes should not exceed 3.0 for balance.
        
        Also select a resource priority that this agent should focus on (energy, materials, data, or territory).
        
        You must return a valid JSON object with the following format:
        {
          "role": "collector|explorer|defender|attacker",
          "attributes": {
            "speed": 0.X,
            "health": 0.X,
            "attack": 0.X,
            "defense": 0.X,
            "carryCapacity": 0.X
          },
          "priority": "energy|materials|data|territory",
          "description": "Brief description of this agent's specialization"
        }
