# AI Territory Control Game Project Tracker

## Project Overview
Building a browser-based strategic game where LLM-powered teams create and control AI agents competing for resources and territory.

## Current Implementation Stage: Stage 1 - Basic Rendering
Status: Complete - Ready for Testing

## Todo List:
- [x] Set up HTML canvas (800x600)
- [x] Implement game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Create basic rendering system
- [x] Implement camera/viewport system
- [x] Add FPS counter and performance overlay

## Completed:
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Create basic directory structure
- [x] Create main HTML file with canvas
- [x] Implement game engine with render and camera systems
- [x] Add debug grid and performance overlay
- [x] Add camera controls for testing

## Development Commands
- Run locally: `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- Take debug screenshot: `npm run screenshot` (saves as debug-screenshot.png)
- Run tests: [TBD]

## Testing Results:
- Visual verification: Ready for testing
- Console error check: Ready for testing
- Game loop timing tests: Ready for testing
- Browser compatibility: Ready for testing

## Testing Instructions:
1. Run the game with `npm start`
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Verify the canvas appears with colored shapes and a grid
4. Check that the FPS counter is displaying around 60 FPS
5. Test camera controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys to move camera (when not following target)
   - Q/E to zoom in/out
   - T to toggle following the moving white circle
6. For debugging or documentation:
   - Run `npm run screenshot` to capture the current game state
   - Check the debug-screenshot.png file in the project root

## Issues and Solutions:
- None so far

## Next Stage Preparation:
- [x] Review game world design requirements
- [ ] Plan territory grid implementation
- [ ] Prepare for resource system design

## Stage Progression
- Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window
- Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources
- Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
- Stage 4: Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
- Stage 5: LLM Agent Piloting
- Stage 6: LLM Team Spawner Implementation
- Final Stage: Polish and Refinement

## Notes for Claude
- When starting a new stage, update this file with the stage's todo list
- Mark tasks as complete as they are finished
- Record issues and solutions encountered
- Document testing results for stage criteria
- Update stage status as appropriate
