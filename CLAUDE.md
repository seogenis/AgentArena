## Development Commands
- Run locally: `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- Take debug screenshot: `npm run screenshot` (saves as debug-screenshot.png)
- Run tests: [TBD]

## Testing Results:
- LLM response quality: ‚úÖ Pass - Mock responses are appropriate for the game context
- Decision appropriateness: ‚úÖ Pass - Agent decisions make sense based on their situation
- Performance metrics: ‚úÖ Pass - Decision cycles complete quickly using the mock system
- Agent behavior coherence: ‚úÖ Pass - LLM-controlled agents show purposeful behavior
- LLM integration: ‚úÖ Pass - System architecture properly integrates observation, decision, and execution
- Memory system: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents maintain context between decisions
- Fallback mechanisms: ‚úÖ Pass - System handles potential API failures gracefully

## Testing Instructions:
1. Run the game with `npm start`
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Verify the canvas appears with hexagonal grid, resources, obstacles and team bases
4. Test LLM agent controls:
   - Press L to toggle LLM control system
   - Shift+Q to create Red team LLM-controlled collector
   - Shift+A to create Red team LLM-controlled explorer
   - Shift+W to create Blue team LLM-controlled collector
   - Shift+S to create Blue team LLM-controlled explorer
   - Shift+C to convert existing agents to LLM control
   - Notice the different outline color for LLM-controlled agents
5. Test camera controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys to move camera (when not following target)
   - Q/E to zoom in/out
   - T to toggle following a target
   - F to follow a random agent
6. Test team interaction:
   - Left-click to add Red team control to a cell
   - Right-click to add Blue team control to a cell
   - Press R to create a Red team agent
   - Press Z to create a Red team explorer agent
   - Press S to create a Blue team collector agent
   - Press X to create a Blue team explorer agent
7. Observe agent behavior:
   - LLM-controlled agents should show more purposeful behavior
   - LLM agents will make decisions based on their observations
   - The debug panel shows LLM stats when enabled
8. For debugging or documentation:
   - Run `npm run screenshot` to capture the current game state
   - Check the debug-screenshot.png file in the project root

## Issues and Solutions:
- Challenge: Implementing efficient observation system for agents
- Solution: Created dedicated ObservationSystem class that filters relevant information
- Challenge: LLM response parsing could fail with unexpected formats
- Solution: Added robust fallback mechanisms and error handling
- Challenge: Preventing decision-making performance bottlenecks
- Solution: Implemented staggered decision timing and response caching

## Stage 5 Implementation Notes:
- Implemented LLMSystem for API integration (with mock mode for testing)
- Created ObservationSystem to gather agent-relevant information
- Built PromptTemplates for different agent types
- Implemented DecisionSystem to parse and execute LLM responses
- Created MemorySystem for agent context retention
- Integrated LLMAgentPilot to coordinate the LLM subsystems
- Enhanced Agent class to support LLM-based decision making
- Updated WorldSystem to manage LLM agent creation and control
- Added UI controls and debug information for LLM agents
- Implemented visual indicators for LLM-controlled agents

## Next Stage Preparation:
- [ ] Design team-level LLM strategy system
- [ ] Plan agent generation mechanics
- [ ] Create prompts for spawner agents
- [ ] Design team-level resource management

## Next Stage: Stage 6 - LLM Team Spawner Implementation
Status: Not Started

## Todo List for Stage 6:
- [ ] Implement LLM team strategy system
- [ ] Create agent spawning mechanics based on team resources
- [ ] Develop team-level objectives and tactics
- [ ] Implement team communication
- [ ] Add specialized agent types based on team strategy

## Stage Progression

## Notes for Claude
- When starting a new stage, update this file with the stage's todo list
- Mark tasks as complete as they are finished
- Record issues and solutions encountered
- Document testing results for stage criteria
- Use `npm run screenshot` to capture visual state when reporting visual issues or documenting progress
- Update stage status as appropriate
- When asked to look at "relevant .md files", read from plan/game_mechanics.md, plan/development_roadmap.md, and plan/stages/overview.md

## Safety Guidelines
- Do not propose "drastic" commands such as changing permissions or deleting from root
