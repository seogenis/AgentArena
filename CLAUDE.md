# AI Territory Control Game Project Tracker

## Project Overview
Building a browser-based strategic game where LLM-powered teams create and control AI agents competing for resources and territory.

## Current Implementation Stage: Stage 3 - Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
Status: Completed ‚úÖ

## Current Todo List:
- [x] Create red team base structure
- [x] Create blue team base structure
- [x] Position bases at opposite map corners
- [x] Implement agent rendering with team colors
- [x] Create basic movement system for agents
- [x] Implement collision detection with obstacles

## Completed:
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Create basic directory structure
- [x] Create main HTML file with canvas
- [x] Implement game engine with render and camera systems
- [x] Add debug grid and performance overlay
- [x] Add camera controls for testing
- [x] Fix gameLoop context binding issue
- [x] Complete Stage 1 - Basic Rendering
- [x] Implement hexagonal territory grid system
- [x] Create visual overlay for territory zones
- [x] Implement resource types (energy, materials, data)
- [x] Create resource spawning mechanics
- [x] Design and implement obstacles
- [x] Complete Stage 2 - Game World Design

## Development Commands
- Run locally: `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- Take debug screenshot: `npm run screenshot` (saves as debug-screenshot.png)
- Run tests: [TBD]

## Testing Results:
- Base rendering: ‚úÖ Pass - Red and blue bases are visible at opposite corners
- Agent appearance: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents clearly display team colors and types
- Movement patterns: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents move in predefined patterns seeking resources
- Collision detection: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents properly avoid obstacles
- Resource collection: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents collect resources and return to base
- Visual clarity test: ‚úÖ Pass - All game elements are visually distinct
- Console error check: ‚úÖ Pass - No errors during operation
- Game loop timing tests: ‚úÖ Pass - Stable FPS (60+)
- Browser compatibility: ‚úÖ Pass - Tested in Chrome

## Testing Instructions:
1. Run the game with `npm start`
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Verify the canvas appears with hexagonal grid, resources, and obstacles
4. Check that the FPS counter is displaying around 60 FPS
5. Verify that bases appear in opposite corners (red in bottom-left, blue in top-right)
6. Verify that agents from both teams are visible and moving
7. Test camera controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys to move camera (when not following target)
   - Q/E to zoom in/out
   - T to toggle following the moving white circle
8. Test territory control:
   - Left-click to add Red team control to a cell
   - Right-click to add Blue team control to a cell
9. Test resource interactions:
   - Press 1, 2, or 3 to add different resources (Energy, Materials, Data)
   - Press C to collect a resource
10. Test obstacle placement:
   - Press O to add an obstacle at cursor position
11. Test agent creation:
   - Press A to add Red collector agent at cursor
   - Press Z to add Red explorer agent at cursor
   - Press S to add Blue collector agent at cursor
   - Press X to add Blue explorer agent at cursor
12. Watch agents collect resources and return to base
13. Verify info panel shows updated resource counts, territory control, and base resources
14. For debugging or documentation:
   - Run `npm run screenshot` to capture the current game state
   - Check the debug-screenshot.png file in the project root

## Issues and Solutions:
- Fixed game loop context binding issue that was causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isRunning')" error
- Solution: Properly bound the gameLoop function to the engine instance with .bind(this)

## Stage 3 Implementation Notes:
- Created red and blue team base structures positioned at opposite corners of the map
- Implemented agent system with team-specific visual appearances
- Added two agent types: Collectors and Explorers with distinct behaviors
- Implemented resource collection and carrying mechanics
- Developed basic AI for agents to seek resources, avoid obstacles, and return to base
- Built collision detection system for obstacles and other agents
- Enhanced debug overlay with base resource counters and agent information
- Territory is now influenced by agent movement
- Set up resource deposit system at team bases

## Next Stage Preparation:
- [x] Design base camp visuals for each team
- [x] Plan agent movement and collision systems
- [x] Design resource collection mechanics
- [x] Prepare agent AI behavior patterns

## Next Stage: Stage 4 - Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
Status: Not Started

## Todo List for Stage 4:
- [ ] Implement agent-to-agent interactions
- [ ] Add combat mechanics between opposing agents
- [ ] Create resource transfer between friendly agents
- [ ] Implement territory influence scoring
- [ ] Add win condition detection

## Stage Progression
- ‚úÖ Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window
- ‚úÖ Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources
- ‚úÖ Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
- üîÑ Stage 4: Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 5: LLM Agent Piloting
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 6: LLM Team Spawner Implementation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Final Stage: Polish and Refinement

## Notes for Claude
- When starting a new stage, update this file with the stage's todo list
- Mark tasks as complete as they are finished
- Record issues and solutions encountered
- Document testing results for stage criteria
- Use `npm run screenshot` to capture visual state when reporting visual issues or documenting progress
- Update stage status as appropriate
- When asked to look at "relevant context", read from plan/game_mechanics.md, plan/development_roadmap.md, and plan/stages/overview.md

## Safety Guidelines
- Do not propose "drastic" commands such as changing permissions or deleting from root
