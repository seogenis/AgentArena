# AI Territory Control Game Project Tracker

## Project Overview
Building a browser-based strategic game where LLM-powered teams create and control AI agents competing for resources and territory.

## Current Implementation Stage: Stage 4 - Game Mechanics
Status: Completed ‚úÖ

## Current Todo List:
- [x] Implement agent-to-agent interactions
- [x] Add combat mechanics between agents
- [x] Enhance resource collection to affect agent attributes
- [x] Implement team-based resource allocation
- [x] Add victory condition checks

## Completed:
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Create basic directory structure
- [x] Create main HTML file with canvas
- [x] Implement game engine with render and camera systems
- [x] Add debug grid and performance overlay
- [x] Add camera controls for testing
- [x] Fix gameLoop context binding issue
- [x] Complete Stage 1 - Basic Rendering
- [x] Implement hexagonal territory grid system
- [x] Create visual overlay for territory zones
- [x] Implement resource types (energy, materials, data)
- [x] Create resource spawning mechanics
- [x] Design and implement obstacles
- [x] Complete Stage 2 - Game World Design

## Development Commands
- Run locally: `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- Take debug screenshot: `npm run screenshot` (saves as debug-screenshot.png)
- Run tests: [TBD]

## Testing Results:
- Combat mechanics: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents engage in combat when encountering enemies
- Resource collection: ‚úÖ Pass - Resources properly affect agent attributes
- Agent healing: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents heal when near their base
- Combat visuals: ‚úÖ Pass - Combat effects visible with appropriate team colors
- Victory conditions: ‚úÖ Pass - Game declares winner when conditions are met
- Resource dropping: ‚úÖ Pass - Dead agents drop resources they were carrying
- Visual feedback: ‚úÖ Pass - Health bars and combat indicators are clear
- Territory control: ‚úÖ Pass - Territory control properly influences victory condition
- Game reset: ‚úÖ Pass - Game can be restarted after victory
- Combat toggle: ‚úÖ Pass - Combat can be toggled on/off for testing

## Testing Instructions:
1. Run the game with `npm start`
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Verify the canvas appears with hexagonal grid, resources, obstacles and team bases
4. Check that the FPS counter is displaying around 60 FPS
5. Test camera controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys to move camera (when not following target)
   - Q/E to zoom in/out
   - T to toggle following a target
   - F to follow a random agent
6. Test team interaction:
   - Left-click to add Red team control to a cell
   - Right-click to add Blue team control to a cell
   - Press R to create a Red team agent
   - Press Z to create a Red team explorer agent
   - Press S to create a Blue team collector agent
   - Press X to create a Blue team explorer agent
7. Test combat system:
   - Press P to toggle combat on/off
   - Press H to test hit effect at cursor position
   - Press K to test death effect at cursor position
   - Create agents from both teams and observe them engage in combat
   - Observe health bars and attack indicators
8. Test resource interactions:
   - Press 1, 2, or 3 to add different resources (Energy, Materials, Data)
   - Press C to collect a resource manually
   - Observe agents collecting resources and returning to their bases
   - Kill an agent carrying resources to see resources drop
9. Test victory conditions:
   - Control 75% of territory to trigger territory control victory
   - Eliminate all agents of one team to trigger elimination victory
   - Accumulate 10x the resources of the opponent to trigger resource victory
   - Press R when game is over to restart the game
10. For debugging or documentation:
   - Run `npm run screenshot` to capture the current game state
   - Check the debug-screenshot.png file in the project root
   - It is okay if things don't work or you don't know if test / screenshot worked, just make sure to inform the user

## Issues and Solutions:
- Fixed combat effect visualization issue
- Solution: Created a dedicated CombatSystem class to handle visual effects
- Added game reset functionality to restart after a victory
- Improved combat targeting to prefer enemies without resources
- Enhanced territory influence to affect victory conditions

## Stage 4 Implementation Notes:
- Implemented CombatSystem with visual hit and death effects
- Added agent health bars and damage visualization
- Created combat mechanics with attack and defense stats
- Implemented resource dropping when agents die
- Added healing mechanics when agents are near their base
- Created three victory conditions: territory control, agent elimination, and resource domination
- Added game over state with winner declaration
- Created reset functionality to restart the game
- Implemented combat toggling for testing
- Enhanced keyboard controls to interact with new features

## Next Stage Preparation:
- [ ] Design LLM prompt templates for agent control
- [ ] Plan agent observation and decision-making system
- [ ] Design LLM integration architecture
- [ ] Create basic API integration for LLM access

## Next Stage: Stage 5 - LLM Agent Piloting
Status: Not Started

## Todo List for Stage 5:
- [ ] Implement LLM-based agent decision making
- [ ] Create agent observation system
- [ ] Design and implement agent memory
- [ ] Add communication between agents
- [ ] Develop agent personality traits

## Stage Progression
- ‚úÖ Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window
- ‚úÖ Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources
- ‚úÖ Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
- ‚úÖ Stage 4: Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
- üîÑ Stage 5: LLM Agent Piloting
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 6: LLM Team Spawner Implementation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Final Stage: Polish and Refinement

## Notes for Claude
- When starting a new stage, update this file with the stage's todo list
- Mark tasks as complete as they are finished
- Record issues and solutions encountered
- Document testing results for stage criteria
- Use `npm run screenshot` to capture visual state when reporting visual issues or documenting progress
- Update stage status as appropriate
- When asked to look at "relevant .md files", read from plan/game_mechanics.md, plan/development_roadmap.md, and plan/stages/overview.md

## Safety Guidelines
- Do not propose "drastic" commands such as changing permissions or deleting from root
