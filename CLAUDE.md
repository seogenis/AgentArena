- Agent spawning: âœ… Pass - LLM can create specialized agents
- Agent behavior: âœ… Pass - Different agent roles follow distinct behaviors
- Resource priorities: âœ… Pass - Agents respect resource priorities set by LLM

## Testing Instructions:
1. Run the game with `npm start`
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Verify the canvas appears with hexagonal grid, resources, obstacles and team bases
4. Check that the FPS counter is displaying around 60 FPS
5. Test camera controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys to move camera (when not following target)
   - Q/E to zoom in/out
   - T to toggle following a target
   - F to follow a random agent
6. Test team interaction:
   - Left-click to add Red team control to a cell
   - Right-click to add Blue team control to a cell
   - Press R to create a Red team agent
   - Press Z to create a Red team explorer agent
   - Press S to create a Blue team collector agent
   - Press X to create a Blue team explorer agent
7. Test combat system:
   - Press P to toggle combat on/off
   - Press H to test hit effect at cursor position
   - Press K to test death effect at cursor position
   - Create agents from both teams and observe them engage in combat
   - Observe health bars and attack indicators
8. Test resource interactions:
   - Press 1, 2, or 3 to add different resources (Energy, Materials, Data)
   - Press C to collect a resource manually
   - Observe agents collecting resources and returning to their bases
   - Kill an agent carrying resources to see resources drop
9. Test victory conditions:
   - Control 75% of territory to trigger territory control victory
   - Eliminate all agents of one team to trigger elimination victory
   - Accumulate 10x the resources of the opponent to trigger resource victory
   - Press R when game is over to restart the game
10. Test LLM features:
   - Press L to toggle LLM systems on/off
   - Press G to request a new strategy for Red team
   - Press B to request a new strategy for Blue team 
   - Press N to request a new agent for Red team
   - Press M to request a new agent for Blue team
   - Observe LLM-generated agents with different shapes and attributes
   - Compare behavior of different agent types (collector, explorer, defender, attacker)
11. For debugging or documentation:
   - Run `npm run screenshot` to capture the current game state
   - Check the debug-screenshot.png file in the project root
   - It is okay if things don't work or you don't know if test / screenshot worked, just make sure to inform the user

## Issues and Solutions:
- Fixed combat effect visualization issue
- Solution: Created a dedicated CombatSystem class to handle visual effects
- Added game reset functionality to restart after a victory
- Improved combat targeting to prefer enemies without resources
- Enhanced territory influence to affect victory conditions
- Handled browser environment limitations for API access
- Solution: Added mock response system for LLM API calls
- Fixed team ID inconsistency between numeric (1/2) and string ('red'/'blue') formats
- Solution: Added conversion methods to handle both formats consistently
- Created resilient agent pattern selection with fallbacks
- Solution: Added pattern validation and defaults in agent movement setup

## Stage 5 Implementation Notes:
- Implemented LLMService for API communication with fallback behaviors
- Created PromptTemplates system for team strategy and agent creation
- Developed TeamStrategySystem for team-level decision making
- Implemented SpawnerSystem for LLM-based agent creation
- Added SpawnScheduler to manage agent creation timing
- Created new agent roles: defender and attacker with specialized behaviors
- Enhanced Agent class to support LLM-defined attributes and resource priorities
- Added resource allocation system based on agent specifications
- Implemented specialized movement patterns for different agent roles
- Created unique visual representations for different agent types
- Added keyboard controls for testing LLM features
- Enhanced debug overlay to show team strategies
- Set up mock response system for development without API keys

## Next Stage Preparation:
- [ ] Enhance game visualization to show LLM decisions
- [ ] Add more complex strategy patterns
- [ ] Design improved UI for LLM status
- [ ] Optimize game performance

## Next Stage: Final Stage - Polish and Refinement
Status: Not Started

## Todo List for Final Stage:
- [ ] Add visual indicators for LLM decision making
- [ ] Create better team strategy visualization
- [ ] Improve the UI for displaying team strategies
- [ ] Add agent status indicators (role, priority, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize performance with many agents
- [ ] Add game balance adjustments
- [ ] Enhance visual effects
- [ ] Add sound effects

## Stage Progression
- âœ… Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window
- âœ… Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources
- âœ… Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
- âœ… Stage 4: Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
- âœ… Stage 5: LLM Team Spawners
- ðŸ”„ Final Stage: Polish and Refinement

> **Note**: Stage progression has been revised. Original stages 5 (LLM Agent Piloting) and 6 (LLM Team Spawners) have been consolidated into a single Stage 5 focusing on LLM team spawners. Agent behavior will continue to use hardcoded patterns.

## Notes for Claude
- When starting a new stage, update this file with the stage's todo list
- Mark tasks as complete as they are finished
- Record issues and solutions encountered
- Document testing results for stage criteria
- Use `npm run screenshot` to capture visual state when reporting visual issues or documenting progress
- Update stage status as appropriate
- When asked to look at "relevant .md files", read from plan/game_mechanics.md, plan/development_roadmap.md, and plan/stages/overview.md

## Safety Guidelines
- Do not propose "drastic" commands such as changing permissions or deleting from root
