# AI Territory Control Game Project Tracker

## Project Overview
Building a browser-based strategic game where LLM-powered teams create and control AI agents competing for resources and territory.

## Current Implementation Stage: Stage 2 - Game World Design
Status: Completed ‚úÖ

## Current Todo List:
- [x] Implement hexagonal territory grid system
- [x] Create visual overlay for territory zones
- [x] Implement resource types (energy, materials, data)
- [x] Create resource spawning mechanics
- [x] Design and implement obstacles

## Completed:
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Create basic directory structure
- [x] Create main HTML file with canvas
- [x] Implement game engine with render and camera systems
- [x] Add debug grid and performance overlay
- [x] Add camera controls for testing
- [x] Fix gameLoop context binding issue
- [x] Implement hexagonal grid system for territory
- [x] Create resource system with three resource types
- [x] Implement obstacle generation with different patterns
- [x] Integrate game world with the existing rendering system
- [x] Add additional controls for testing game world features

## Development Commands
- Run locally: `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- Run tests: [TBD]

## Testing Results:
- Grid visualization: ‚úÖ Pass - Hexagonal grid renders correctly
- Resource spawning: ‚úÖ Pass - Resources appear on the map and spawn over time
- Obstacle generation: ‚úÖ Pass - Obstacles render correctly in different patterns
- Visual clarity test: ‚úÖ Pass - All game elements are visually distinct

## Testing Instructions:
1. Run the game with `npm start`
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Verify the hexagonal grid appears with resources and obstacles
4. Test camera controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys to move camera (when not following target)
   - Q/E to zoom in/out
   - T to toggle following the moving white circle
5. Test world features:
   - G: Toggle debug grid
   - 1-3: Test different obstacle patterns
   - R: Reset game world

## Issues and Solutions:
- Adjusted hex grid sizing to ensure proper visual appearance
- Optimized rendering to maintain performance with many grid cells
- Used different colors and visual indicators for resource types for clarity

## Next Stage Preparation:
- [x] Review base camp and agent implementation requirements
- [ ] Plan base camp visual design
- [ ] Design agent movement and interaction systems
- [ ] Prepare team-based agent system

## Next Stage: Stage 3 - Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
Status: Not Started

## Todo List for Stage 3:
- [ ] Create red and blue team base camps
- [ ] Implement team-based agent creation
- [ ] Design agent movement and pathfinding system
- [ ] Implement resource collection mechanics
- [ ] Create basic agent behavior AI

## Stage Progression
- ‚úÖ Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window
- ‚úÖ Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources
- üîÑ Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 4: Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 5: LLM Agent Piloting
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 6: LLM Team Spawner Implementation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Final Stage: Polish and Refinement

## Notes for Claude
- When starting a new stage, update this file with the stage's todo list
- Mark tasks as complete as they are finished
- Record issues and solutions encountered
- Document testing results for stage criteria
- Update stage status as appropriate

## Safety Guidelines
- do not propose "drastic" commands such as changing permissions or deleting from root
