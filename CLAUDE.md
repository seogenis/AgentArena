# AI Territory Control Game Project Tracker

## Project Overview
Building a browser-based strategic game where LLM-powered teams create and control AI agents competing for resources and territory.

## Current Implementation Stage: Stage 3 - Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
Status: Completed ‚úÖ

## Current Todo List:
- [x] Create base camp visual designs for each team
- [x] Implement agent entities with basic attributes
- [x] Add agent movement and control systems
- [x] Implement resource collection mechanics
- [x] Create team-based agent visuals

## Completed:
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Create basic directory structure
- [x] Create main HTML file with canvas
- [x] Implement game engine with render and camera systems
- [x] Add debug grid and performance overlay
- [x] Add camera controls for testing
- [x] Fix gameLoop context binding issue
- [x] Complete Stage 1 - Basic Rendering
- [x] Implement hexagonal territory grid system
- [x] Create visual overlay for territory zones
- [x] Implement resource types (energy, materials, data)
- [x] Create resource spawning mechanics
- [x] Design and implement obstacles
- [x] Complete Stage 2 - Game World Design

## Development Commands
- Run locally: `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- Take debug screenshot: `npm run screenshot` (saves as debug-screenshot.png)
- Run tests: [TBD]

## Testing Results:
- Base rendering: ‚úÖ Pass - Team bases appear correctly in opposite corners
- Agent appearance: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents have distinct team colors and resource indicators
- Movement patterns: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents move smoothly using predefined patterns
- Collision detection: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents properly avoid obstacles
- Resource collection: ‚úÖ Pass - Agents can collect and deliver resources to bases
- Territory control: ‚úÖ Pass - Agent presence affects territory control
- Visual clarity test: ‚úÖ Pass - All game elements are visually distinct
- Console error check: ‚úÖ Pass - No errors during operation
- Game loop timing tests: ‚úÖ Pass - Stable FPS (60+)
- Browser compatibility: ‚úÖ Pass - Tested in Chrome

## Testing Instructions:
1. Run the game with `npm start`
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Verify the canvas appears with hexagonal grid, resources, obstacles and team bases
4. Check that the FPS counter is displaying around 60 FPS
5. Test camera controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys to move camera (when not following target)
   - Q/E to zoom in/out
   - T to toggle following a target
   - F to follow a random agent
6. Test team interaction:
   - Left-click to add Red team control to a cell
   - Right-click to add Blue team control to a cell
   - Press R to create a Red team agent
   - Press B to create a Blue team agent
7. Test resource interactions:
   - Press 1, 2, or 3 to add different resources (Energy, Materials, Data)
   - Press C to collect a resource manually
   - Observe agents collecting resources and returning to their bases
8. Test obstacle placement:
   - Press O to add an obstacle at cursor position
   - Observe agents avoiding obstacles
9. Verify info panel shows updated resource counts, territory control, and agent counts
10. For debugging or documentation:
   - Run `npm run screenshot` to capture the current game state
   - Check the debug-screenshot.png file in the project root

## Issues and Solutions:
- Fixed game loop context binding issue that was causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isRunning')" error
- Solution: Properly bound the gameLoop function to the engine instance with .bind(this)
- Enhanced debug overlay to show team resources and agent counts

## Stage 3 Implementation Notes:
- Created BaseSystem with visually distinct team bases at opposite corners
- Implemented Agent class with team-specific colors and appearances
- Added AgentSystem to manage agent creation, movement, and resource collection
- Created three different movement patterns for agents (patrol, circle, resource)
- Implemented collision detection to avoid obstacles
- Added resource collection and delivery mechanics
- Created territory influence system based on agent presence
- Enhanced debug overlay with team resources and agent information
- Added keyboard shortcuts to create new agents and follow agent movement

## Next Stage Preparation:
- [x] Design agent movement system
- [x] Plan resource collection mechanics
- [x] Design base camp visual structures
- [x] Implement agent-territory influence system

## Next Stage: Stage 4 - Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
Status: Not Started

## Todo List for Stage 4:
- [ ] Implement agent-to-agent interactions
- [ ] Add combat mechanics between agents
- [ ] Enhance resource collection to affect agent attributes
- [ ] Implement team-based resource allocation
- [ ] Add victory condition checks

## Stage Progression
- ‚úÖ Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window
- ‚úÖ Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources
- ‚úÖ Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
- üîÑ Stage 4: Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 5: LLM Agent Piloting
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 6: LLM Team Spawner Implementation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Final Stage: Polish and Refinement

## Notes for Claude
- When starting a new stage, update this file with the stage's todo list
- Mark tasks as complete as they are finished
- Record issues and solutions encountered
- Document testing results for stage criteria
- Use `npm run screenshot` to capture visual state when reporting visual issues or documenting progress
- Update stage status as appropriate
- When asked to look at "relevant context", read from plan/game_mechanics.md, plan/development_roadmap.md, and plan/stages/overview.md

## Safety Guidelines
- Do not propose "drastic" commands such as changing permissions or deleting from root
