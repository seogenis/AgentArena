# AI Territory Control Game Project Tracker

## Project Overview
Building a browser-based strategic game where LLM-powered teams create and control AI agents competing for resources and territory.

## Current Implementation Stage: Stage 1 - Basic Rendering
Status: Completed ‚úÖ

## Current Todo List:
- [x] Set up HTML canvas (800x600)
- [x] Implement game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Create basic rendering system
- [x] Implement camera/viewport system
- [x] Add FPS counter and performance overlay

## Completed:
- [x] Set up project repository
- [x] Create basic directory structure
- [x] Create main HTML file with canvas
- [x] Implement game engine with render and camera systems
- [x] Add debug grid and performance overlay
- [x] Add camera controls for testing
- [x] Fix gameLoop context binding issue

## Development Commands
- Run locally: `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:3000)
- Run tests: [TBD]

## Testing Results:
- Visual verification: ‚úÖ Pass - Canvas renders properly with shapes and grid
- Console error check: ‚úÖ Pass - No errors during operation
- Game loop timing tests: ‚úÖ Pass - Stable FPS (60+)
- Browser compatibility: ‚úÖ Pass - Tested in Chrome

## Testing Instructions:
1. Run the game with `npm start`
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Verify the canvas appears with colored shapes and a grid
4. Check that the FPS counter is displaying around 60 FPS
5. Test camera controls:
   - WASD/Arrow keys to move camera (when not following target)
   - Q/E to zoom in/out
   - T to toggle following the moving white circle

## Issues and Solutions:
- Fixed game loop context binding issue that was causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isRunning')" error
- Solution: Properly bound the gameLoop function to the engine instance with .bind(this)

## Next Stage Preparation:
- [x] Review game world design requirements
- [ ] Plan hexagonal territory grid implementation
- [ ] Design resource types (energy, materials, data)
- [ ] Prepare resource spawning system design

## Next Stage: Stage 2 - Game World Design
Status: Not Started

## Todo List for Stage 2:
- [ ] Implement hexagonal territory grid system
- [ ] Create visual overlay for territory zones
- [ ] Implement resource types (energy, materials, data)
- [ ] Create resource spawning mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement obstacles

## Stage Progression
- ‚úÖ Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window
- üîÑ Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 4: Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 5: LLM Agent Piloting
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stage 6: LLM Team Spawner Implementation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Final Stage: Polish and Refinement

## Notes for Claude
- When starting a new stage, update this file with the stage's todo list
- Mark tasks as complete as they are finished
- Record issues and solutions encountered
- Document testing results for stage criteria
- Update stage status as appropriate

## Safety Guidelines
- do not propose "drastic" commands such as changing permissions or deleting from root
