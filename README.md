# AI Territory Control Game

A browser-based strategic game where LLM-powered teams create and control AI agents competing for resources and territory.

## Project Status

Currently in development - Stage 6 in progress. See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed project status and current implementation stage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (latest LTS recommended)
- NPM
- Python 3.11+ (for backend with AIQToolkit)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up Python backend (required for Stage 6):
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Game

#### Frontend Only (Stages 1-5)
```
npm start
```

#### Full Stack (Stage 6+)
```
docker-compose up
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:3000

### Development Tools

```
# Take a screenshot of the game for debugging/documentation
npm run screenshot
```

This will save a screenshot as `debug-screenshot.png` in the project root.

## Controls

- WASD/Arrow keys: Move camera (when not following target)
- Q/E: Zoom in/out
- T: Toggle camera following the target
- F: Follow a random agent
- Left-click: Add Red team control to a cell
- Right-click: Add Blue team control to a cell
- A/R: Create a Red team collector agent
- Z: Create a Red team explorer agent 
- S/B: Create a Blue team collector agent
- X: Create a Blue team explorer agent
- O: Add obstacle at cursor position
- 1/2/3: Add resources (Energy/Materials/Data)
- C: Collect resource at cursor position
- L: Toggle LLM systems on/off
- G: Request a new strategy for Red team
- B: Request a new strategy for Blue team
- N: Request a new agent for Red team
- M: Request a new agent for Blue team
- P: Toggle combat on/off

### LLM API Configuration
To use the LLM system:
1. Set your API key using window.initializeAPI(your-key)
2. Disable mock responses with window.toggleMockResponses(false)
3. Reset services with window.reinitializeLLMServices()

## Development Roadmap

This game is being developed in stages:

1. Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window âœ…
2. Game World Design with Resources âœ…
3. Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents âœ…
4. Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics âœ…
5. LLM Team Spawners âœ…
6. AIQToolkit Integration ðŸ”„
7. Polish and Refinement â¬œ

See the [plan directory](./plan/) for detailed plans for each stage.

## Implementation Teams

For Stage 6 implementation, the project is divided into the following teams:

### Frontend Team
Responsible for modifying the JavaScript frontend to communicate with the Python backend and enhancing the visualization of team strategies and agent decisions.

### Backend Team
Responsible for implementing the Python backend with FastAPI and AIQToolkit, creating workflows for team strategy generation and agent creation.

### DevOps Team
Responsible for containerizing the frontend and backend, setting up environment variable management, and configuring CORS for secure communication.
