# Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents - ✅ COMPLETED

## Goal
Implement team bases and agents with basic hardcoded movement.

## Implementation Requirements
- Create red and blue team base structures
- Position bases at opposite corners of the map
- Implement agent rendering with team colors
- Program basic hardcoded movement patterns for test agents
- Implement collision detection with obstacles

## Expected Results
- Visible base structures for both teams
- Distinct agent appearances by team
- Agents moving in predefined patterns
- Proper collision handling with obstacles

## Testing Methods
- **Visual**: Verify agent movement, base appearance
- **Console**: Logs for agent position updates, collisions
- **JS Tests**: Unit tests for movement calculations, collision detection
- **User Verification**: Confirm natural-looking movement

## Completion Criteria
- Bases render in correct positions
- Agents visually distinct by team
- Movement appears smooth and natural
- Collision detection works reliably

## Completion Summary
- ✅ Created BaseSystem with distinct red and blue team bases at opposite corners
- ✅ Implemented Agent class with team-specific colors and visuals for collector and explorer types
- ✅ Added multiple movement patterns for agents (patrol, circle, resource, and exploration)
- ✅ Implemented collision detection with ObstacleSystem
- ✅ Added resource collection and delivery mechanics
- ✅ Created territory influence system based on agent presence
- ✅ Enhanced debug overlay to show team resources and agent information
- ✅ Added keyboard controls to create agents and follow their movement with camera
- ✅ All testing criteria passed with smooth agent movement and proper collision handling
