# Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window

## Goal
Establish the foundational game window with basic rendering capabilities.

## Implementation Requirements
- Set up HTML canvas with 800x600 viewport
- Implement basic game loop (requestAnimationFrame)
- Create simple rendering system for shapes/sprites
- Implement basic camera/viewport system
- Create debug overlay for performance metrics

## Expected Results
- Empty game world renders properly in browser
- FPS counter shows stable performance
- Window resizes appropriately

## Testing Methods
- **Visual**: Confirm canvas appears and renders properly
- **Console**: Check for rendering errors
- **JS Tests**: Test game loop timing and rendering calls
- **User Verification**: Test in multiple browsers

## Completion Criteria
- Clean render of empty game world
- Stable FPS (60+)
- No console errors
