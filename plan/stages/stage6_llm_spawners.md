# Stage 6: AIQToolkit Integration

## Goal
Enhance the LLM-based agent system by integrating NVIDIA's AIQToolkit with a Python backend to enable more sophisticated team strategies and agent behaviors.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend Team Tasks
- [ ] Modify JavaScript LLMService to communicate with Python backend
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanism when backend is unavailable
- [ ] Add visual indicators for AIQToolkit-driven decisions
- [ ] Enhance visualization of team strategies and agent decisions
- [ ] Add UI for displaying backend connection status

### Backend Team Tasks
- [ ] Set up Python backend with FastAPI and AIQToolkit
- [ ] Design AIQToolkit workflows for team strategy generation
- [ ] Create AIQToolkit workflows for agent creation and specialization
- [ ] Implement REST API endpoints for frontend communication
- [ ] Add WebSocket support for real-time updates (optional)

### DevOps Team Tasks
- [ ] Containerize frontend and backend for easier deployment
- [ ] Create Docker Compose configuration for development
- [ ] Set up environment variable management
- [ ] Configure CORS for secure communication

## Technical Implementation Details

### Python Backend Components
1. **FastAPI Application**
   - Main application setup with CORS configuration
   - API endpoints for team strategy and agent creation
   - Optional WebSocket support

2. **AIQToolkit Workflows**
   - Team Strategy Workflow: Analyzes game state and generates cohesive team strategies
   - Agent Creation Workflow: Designs specialized agents based on team needs
   - Strategy Adaptation Workflow: Adapts strategies to counter opponent moves

3. **Service Layer**
   - Strategy Service: Handles team strategy generation
   - Agent Service: Manages agent creation and specialization
   - Game State Service: Processes and analyzes current game state

### JavaScript Frontend Modifications
1. **LLMService Updates**
   - Communication with Python backend
   - Fallback to direct LLM calls when backend unavailable
   - Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Strategy visualization improvements
   - Agent specialization indicators
   - Backend connection status display

### Integration Components
1. **API Communication**
   - REST endpoints for strategy and agent creation
   - Data validation with JSON schemas
   - Optional WebSocket for real-time updates

2. **Deployment Architecture**
   - Docker containers for frontend and backend
   - Docker Compose for development environment
   - Environment variable configuration

## Expected Results
- More sophisticated team strategies using AIQToolkit's agent coordination
- Enhanced agent specialization and role assignment
- Better adaptation to opponent behaviors
- Improved resource allocation optimization
- Visual indicators of AIQToolkit-driven decisions

## Testing Methods
- **API Tests**: Verify API endpoints for strategy and agent generation
- **Integration Tests**: Test communication between JS frontend and Python backend
- **Performance**: Measure response times and optimization gains
- **Visual**: Verify enhanced strategic behaviors and coordinated agent actions
- **Fallback Testing**: Ensure graceful degradation when backend is unavailable

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Team Strategy Generation**
   - Python backend successfully generates team strategies
   - Strategies are more sophisticated than previous implementation
   - Frontend displays strategies correctly

2. **Agent Creation**
   - Python backend creates specialized agent specifications
   - Agents show more sophisticated attributes and behaviors
   - Resource allocation is optimized based on team needs

3. **Communication**
   - Frontend successfully communicates with backend API
   - Response times remain under 2-3 seconds
   - WebSocket updates (if implemented) provide real-time information

4. **Fallback Behavior**
   - Game continues to function when backend is unavailable
   - Graceful degradation to previous implementation
   - Clear user notification of reduced functionality

5. **Visualization**
   - Enhanced visualization of team strategies
   - Clear indicators of agent specializations
   - Visual feedback of backend connection status
