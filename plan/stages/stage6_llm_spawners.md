# Stage 6: LLM Team Spawner Implementation

## Goal
Implement LLM-controlled team strategy and agent generation.

## Implementation Requirements
- Create team-level LLM integration
- Implement agent generation system based on LLM specifications
- Design team strategy prompt templates
- Create resource allocation system for spawning
- Implement communication between team strategy and agents

## Expected Results
- Unique agents being generated by LLM spawner
- Team-level strategic decision making
- Varied agent types based on strategy
- Coherent team behavior

## Testing Methods
- **Console**: Logs of agent generation prompts/responses
- **Visual**: Verify diverse agent creation and strategic positioning
- **JS Tests**: Unit tests for agent attribute allocation
- **Game Balance**: Test various scenarios for balanced gameplay

## Completion Criteria
- Agent generation produces interesting, varied results
- Team strategy appears coherent
- Overall gameplay is balanced and engaging
- Performance remains stable with full LLM integration
