# Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources

## Goal
Implement the visual design of the game world with territory grid and resources.

## Implementation Requirements
- Create territory grid system (hexagonal zones)
- Implement territory visualization (color overlays)
- Design and implement resource types (energy, materials, data)
- Create resource spawning system
- Implement basic obstacle generation

## Expected Results
- Visual grid of territory zones
- Resources appearing on the map
- Obstacles visible in game world
- Color-coding for different elements

## Testing Methods
- **Visual**: Verify grid layout, resource appearance
- **Console**: Debug logs for grid generation, resource spawning
- **JS Tests**: Unit tests for grid calculations, resource placement
- **User Verification**: Confirm visual clarity of game elements

## Completion Criteria
- Grid visually matches design specifications
- Resources spawn and display correctly
- Obstacles generate without visual glitches
- Territory zones clearly delineated
