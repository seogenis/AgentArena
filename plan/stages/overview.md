# Implementation Stages Overview

This directory contains detailed plans for each implementation stage of the AI Territory Control Game. Each stage has its own markdown file with specific requirements, testing methods, and completion criteria.

## Development Best Practices

1. **Stage Tracking**: 
   - Update CLAUDE.md at the beginning of each stage with the stage's todo list
   - Mark items as complete when finished
   - Tag each stage as "In Progress", "Awaiting Debugging", or "Complete"

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant .md files after completing each stage
   - Document any issues encountered and how they were resolved
   - Capture screenshots of working implementations for reference

3. **Testing**:
   - Follow test procedures specified for each stage
   - Document test results in CLAUDE.md
   - Use `npm run screenshot` to capture game state for documentation and bug reports
   - Fix any issues before proceeding to the next stage

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Maintain clean code separation between systems
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Add minimal inline comments for complex logic

## CLAUDE.md Template

Each stage file includes a CLAUDE.md template section that should be used to update the project's CLAUDE.md file when beginning work on that stage. This ensures consistent tracking and documentation throughout development.
