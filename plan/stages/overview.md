# Implementation Stages Overview

This directory contains detailed plans for each implementation stage of the AI Territory Control Game. Each stage has its own markdown file with specific requirements, testing methods, and completion criteria.

## Development Best Practices

1. **Stage Tracking**: 
   - Update CLAUDE.md at the beginning of each stage with the stage's todo list
   - Mark items as complete when finished
   - Tag each stage as "In Progress", "Awaiting Debugging", or "Complete"

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant .md files after completing each stage
   - Document any issues encountered and how they were resolved
   - Capture screenshots of working implementations for reference

3. **Testing**:
   - Follow test procedures specified for each stage
   - Document test results in CLAUDE.md
   - Use `npm run screenshot` to capture game state for documentation and bug reports
   - Fix any issues before proceeding to the next stage

4. **Code Organization**:
   - Maintain clean code separation between systems
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Add minimal inline comments for complex logic

## Enhanced Game Design Philosophy

With our goal of enabling unprecedented AI creativity, the implementation stages now follow a progressive enhancement approach:

1. **Core Mechanics First**: Build solid, flexible foundations before adding complexity
2. **Emergent Systems**: Design systems that interact to create unexpected outcomes
3. **Information Asymmetry**: Create strategic depth through limited perception
4. **Evolution & Growth**: Allow agents and teams to develop and change over time
5. **Narrative Integration**: Weave gameplay and storytelling together
6. **Multiple Victory Paths**: Create different ways to succeed beyond combat

## Key Cross-Cutting Systems

Several systems span multiple implementation stages:

1. **[Unified Observability System](/plan/unified_observability_system.md)**: The perception framework that enables all agent decision-making
2. **Resource Evolution System**: How basic resources can transform into complex ones
3. **Agent Development System**: How agents grow and specialize through experience
4. **Team Culture System**: How teams develop unique identities and capabilities
5. **Environmental Dynamics**: How the game world responds to and shapes gameplay

## Stages Summary

1. [**Basic Rendering**](./stage1_basic_rendering.md) - âœ… COMPLETED - Established foundational game window with basic rendering
2. [**Game World Design**](./stage2_game_world.md) - âœ… COMPLETED - Implemented territory grid and resources
3. [**Base Camps and Agents**](./stage3_bases_and_agents.md) - âœ… COMPLETED - Added team bases and hardcoded agents with resource collection
4. [**Game Mechanics**](./stage4_game_mechanics.md) - âœ… COMPLETED - Implemented core interactions and gameplay systems
5. [**LLM Agent Piloting**](./stage5_llm_pilots.md) - ðŸ”„ NEXT - Replace hardcoded behaviors with LLM control and unified observability
6. [**LLM Team Spawners**](./stage6_llm_spawners.md) - Add LLM-based team strategy, agent evolution, and emergent resources
7. [**Polish and Narrative**](./stage7_polish.md) - Fine-tune gameplay, add narrative elements, and implement asymmetric victory conditions

## Stage Progression Philosophy

Each stage builds on previous ones while adding distinct new value:

- **Stage 1**: A functional visual canvas - *You can see the game world*
- **Stage 2**: A world with resources and territory - *The game has a spatial strategy element*
- **Stage 3**: Agents that interact with the world - *The game has active entities following rules*
- **Stage 4**: Complete gameplay loop - *The game is playable with defined victory conditions*
- **Stage 5**: Individual agent intelligence - *Agents make interesting, personality-driven decisions*
- **Stage 6**: Team-level emergent strategies - *Teams develop unique approaches and capabilities*
- **Stage 7**: Rich, narrative-driven experience - *The game tells emergent stories through gameplay*

## CLAUDE.md Template

Each stage file includes a CLAUDE.md template section that should be used to update the project's CLAUDE.md file when beginning work on that stage. This ensures consistent tracking and documentation throughout development.
