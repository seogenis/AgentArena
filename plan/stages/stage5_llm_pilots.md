# [DEPRECATED] Stage 5: LLM Agent Piloting

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: This file is deprecated. The project structure has been revised, and Stages 5 (LLM Agent Piloting) and 6 (LLM Team Spawners) were consolidated into a single Stage 5: LLM Team Spawners.
>
> Please refer to [stage5_llm_spawners.md](./stage5_llm_spawners.md) for the current Stage 5 implementation plan.

The original Stage 5 focused on LLM agent piloting (individual agent control), but this approach was replaced with the team spawner approach, which uses LLM for team strategy and agent generation while maintaining hardcoded agent behaviors.
