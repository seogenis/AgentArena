# Development Process and Testing Checkpoints

This document outlines the incremental development process for the AI Territory Control Game, with specific testing checkpoints to ensure functionality before proceeding to the next phase.

## Development Philosophy

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Build the game in small, testable increments
2. **Regular Testing**: Verify functionality at each checkpoint before proceeding
3. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback at key milestones
4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure the game continues to work in the browser at all times
5. **Stage-Based Approach**: Follow the staged implementation plan with clear stopping points

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5 Canvas for 2D rendering
- JavaScript/TypeScript for game logic
- RequestAnimationFrame for game loop
- Web browser as the runtime environment

### Game Engine Components
- Custom-built 2D rendering system
- Physics system for agent movement and collisions
- Resource management system
- Territory control visualization (possibly using heat maps)

### LLM Integration
- API integration with LLM providers (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Prompt engineering for agent behavior and team strategy
- Context/memory management for agents

### Development Tools
- Unit testing framework (Jest or similar)
- Browser compatibility testing
- Performance monitoring tools (FPS counter, etc.)

## Implementation Stages

See the [Stages Directory](./stages/) for detailed breakdown of:
- [Stage 1: Basic Rendering in 2D Game Window](./stages/stage1_basic_rendering.md)
- [Stage 2: Game World Design with Resources](./stages/stage2_game_world.md)
- [Stage 3: Base Camps and Hardcoded Agents](./stages/stage3_bases_and_agents.md)
- [Stage 4: Agent Interactions and Game Mechanics](./stages/stage4_game_mechanics.md)
- [Stage 5: LLM Team Spawners](./stages/stage5_llm_spawners.md)
- [Final Stage: Polish and Refinement](./stages/stage7_polish.md)

> **Note**: The original plan included separate stages for LLM Agent Piloting (Stage 5) and LLM Team Spawners (Stage 6). These have been consolidated into a single Stage 5 focusing exclusively on LLM spawners. Agent behavior will continue to use hardcoded patterns.

Each stage includes specific implementation requirements, expected results, testing methods, and completion criteria. See the [overview document](./stages/overview.md) for development best practices.

## Development Tracking

Progress is tracked in CLAUDE.md at the root of the project, including:
- Current stage status
- Todo items for current stage

12. **Balance and Gameplay**
    - Fine-tune game mechanics and agent behaviors
    - CHECKPOINT: Game session testing with varied strategies
    - TEST: Simulation of different game scenarios

## Testing Methodology

### Unit Testing
- Each system component should have dedicated unit tests
- Tests should verify both expected behavior and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies (like LLM APIs) for deterministic testing

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between multiple systems
- Verify that systems work together as expected
- Test the complete game loop with all systems active

### Visual Verification
- Screenshots of key visual elements
- Verification of animation and effects
- UI element positioning and interaction

### User Testing
- Manual testing of game mechanics
- Verification of game feel and responsiveness
- Testing in different browsers and screen sizes

## Testing Checkpoints

At each checkpoint, the following process should be followed:

1. **Run Unit Tests**: Execute automated tests for the relevant components
2. **Visual Verification**: Capture screenshots of the current state
3. **Console Verification**: Check logs for errors or unexpected behavior
4. **User Verification**: Allow user interaction to confirm functionality
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation with current status and findings

## Test Documentation

For each test checkpoint, document:

1. What was tested
2. Test results (pass/fail)
3. Screenshots or console logs
4. Issues identified
5. Actions taken to resolve issues

## Continuous Integration

- All tests should be automated where possible
- Tests should run automatically on code changes
- Test results should be visible to all developers
