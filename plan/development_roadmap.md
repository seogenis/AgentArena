# Development Process and Testing Checkpoints

This document outlines the incremental development process for the AI Territory Control Game, with specific testing checkpoints to ensure functionality before proceeding to the next phase.

## Development Philosophy

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Build the game in small, testable increments
2. **Regular Testing**: Verify functionality at each checkpoint before proceeding
3. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback at key milestones
4. **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure the game continues to work in the browser at all times

## Development Phases and Checkpoints

### Phase 1: Core Systems Setup

1. **Territory System Implementation**
   - Implement basic grid-based territory zones
   - CHECKPOINT: Visual verification of territory grid overlay
   - TEST: Unit tests for zone creation and ownership state changes

2. **Resource System Implementation**
   - Create resource types and spawning mechanism
   - CHECKPOINT: Visual verification of resources appearing on map
   - TEST: Unit tests for resource creation, collection logic

3. **Base Camp Implementation**
   - Create red and blue team base structures
   - CHECKPOINT: Visual verification of bases on opposite corners
   - TEST: Unit tests for base camp functionality

### Phase 2: Agent Enhancements

4. **Team-Based Agent Creation**
   - Modify agent system to include team affiliations
   - CHECKPOINT: Visual verification of red and blue agents
   - TEST: Unit tests for team-specific agent generation

5. **Agent Resource Collection**
   - Implement resource collection and carrying mechanics
   - CHECKPOINT: UI visualization of agents collecting and returning resources
   - TEST: Unit tests for resource collection and storage

6. **Territory Control Mechanics**
   - Implement agent influence on territory zones
   - CHECKPOINT: Visual verification of zone capture mechanics
   - TEST: Unit tests for territory influence calculations

### Phase 3: LLM Integration

7. **Enhanced Agent Creation**
   - Implement LLM-based team-specific agent generation
   - CHECKPOINT: Console verification of LLM prompts and responses
   - TEST: Unit tests for agent creation with mock LLM responses

8. **Agent Pilot Enhancement**
   - Implement richer decision-making for agent pilots
   - CHECKPOINT: Logging of agent decisions to verify logic
   - TEST: Unit tests for decision-making with simulated game states

9. **Strategy Layer**
   - Implement team-level strategy via LLM
   - CHECKPOINT: Verification of strategy recommendations
   - TEST: Unit tests for strategy generation with mock data

### Phase 4: Polish and Refinement

10. **UI Improvements**
    - Enhance visualization and control interfaces
    - CHECKPOINT: User testing of interface clarity and functionality
    - TEST: Automated UI tests for key functions

11. **Performance Optimization**
    - Optimize rendering and calculation systems
    - CHECKPOINT: FPS monitoring during gameplay
    - TEST: Performance benchmarks in different scenarios

12. **Balance and Gameplay**
    - Fine-tune game mechanics and agent behaviors
    - CHECKPOINT: Game session testing with varied strategies
    - TEST: Simulation of different game scenarios

## Testing Methodology

### Unit Testing
- Each system component should have dedicated unit tests
- Tests should verify both expected behavior and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies (like LLM APIs) for deterministic testing

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between multiple systems
- Verify that systems work together as expected
- Test the complete game loop with all systems active

### Visual Verification
- Screenshots of key visual elements
- Verification of animation and effects
- UI element positioning and interaction

### User Testing
- Manual testing of game mechanics
- Verification of game feel and responsiveness
- Testing in different browsers and screen sizes

## Testing Checkpoints

At each checkpoint, the following process should be followed:

1. **Run Unit Tests**: Execute automated tests for the relevant components
2. **Visual Verification**: Capture screenshots of the current state
3. **Console Verification**: Check logs for errors or unexpected behavior
4. **User Verification**: Allow user interaction to confirm functionality
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation with current status and findings

## Test Documentation

For each test checkpoint, document:

1. What was tested
2. Test results (pass/fail)
3. Screenshots or console logs
4. Issues identified
5. Actions taken to resolve issues

## Continuous Integration

- All tests should be automated where possible
- Tests should run automatically on code changes
- Test results should be visible to all developers
