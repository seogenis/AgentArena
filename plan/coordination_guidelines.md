# Coordination Guidelines for Stage 6 Implementation

While the frontend, backend, and DevOps teams can work in parallel, specific coordination is needed to ensure all components fit coherently together. This document outlines the coordination requirements and guidelines.

## API Contract Definition Phase

**Before starting separate implementation:**

1. **Joint Planning Session**:
   - All three teams should meet to define and document API contracts
   - Agree on endpoint URLs, request/response formats, and error handling
   - Document the API contract in a shared specification

2. **Create API Specification Document**:
   - Define all endpoints (URLs, methods, parameters)
   - Document request and response data models
   - Specify error codes and their meanings
   - Document WebSocket protocol (if implemented)

3. **Create Shared Data Models**:
   - Define game state structure
   - Define team strategy structure
   - Define agent specification structure
   - Document validation rules for all models

## Development Coordination

### Weekly Synchronization Meeting
Schedule a weekly meeting where all teams share:
- Progress updates
- Changes to API contracts (if any)
- Issues encountered
- Upcoming milestones

### Integration Checkpoints
Define specific checkpoints for integration testing:

1. **Checkpoint 1 (End of Week 1)**:
   - Backend: Basic API endpoints implemented (returning mock data)
   - Frontend: Basic API client implemented (with mock handling)
   - DevOps: Basic Docker configuration for local development

2. **Checkpoint 2 (End of Week 2)**:
   - Backend: Core AIQToolkit workflows implemented
   - Frontend: LLMService with fallback behavior implemented
   - DevOps: Docker configuration with environment variables

3. **Checkpoint 3 (End of Week 3)**:
   - Full integration test of all components
   - End-to-end testing of main workflows
   - Performance testing

## Communication Channels

1. **Shared Documentation Repository**:
   - Keep API specifications in version control
   - Document any changes to the API contract
   - Notify all teams of changes

2. **Daily Status Updates**:
   - Brief Slack/email updates on progress
   - Flag any issues that might affect other teams
   - Share any changes to implementation plans

3. **Code Review Across Teams**:
   - Frontend team reviews backend API implementation
   - Backend team reviews frontend API client implementation
   - DevOps team reviews configuration in both components

## Handling API Changes

If changes to the API contract are needed:

1. Document the proposed change and its rationale
2. Share with all teams for review
3. Get explicit approval from affected teams
4. Update the API specification document
5. Implement changes with clear versioning
6. Notify all teams when changes are implemented

## Testing Strategy

### Component Testing
- Each team tests their components independently
- Use mock data/services for dependencies

### Integration Testing
- Scheduled integration tests at each checkpoint
- Test specific user journeys end-to-end
- Document test results and issues

### Test Environment
- DevOps team provides a shared test environment
- Environment reflects production configuration
- Accessible to all teams for testing

## Deployment Coordination

For the initial deployment:

1. **Deployment Planning Session**:
   - Review deployment architecture
   - Define deployment sequence
   - Assign responsibilities for deployment steps

2. **Staged Deployment**:
   - Deploy backend services first
   - Verify backend functionality
   - Deploy frontend components
   - Conduct end-to-end testing

3. **Rollback Plan**:
   - Define criteria for deployment success/failure
   - Document rollback procedures
   - Assign responsibilities for rollback decisions

## Specific Team Interfaces

### Frontend ↔ Backend Interface
- API endpoints for team strategy and agent creation
- Error codes and handling
- WebSocket protocol (if implemented)
- Authentication mechanism (if required)

### Frontend ↔ DevOps Interface
- Environment variables needed by frontend
- Build and deployment process
- Frontend configuration for different environments

### Backend ↔ DevOps Interface
- Python dependencies and versions
- Environment variables needed by backend
- AIQToolkit configuration
- Database configuration (if used)

## Risk Mitigation

1. **API Contract Changes**:
   - Version API endpoints if breaking changes are needed
   - Maintain backward compatibility where possible
   - Provide deprecation notices for future changes

2. **Environment Differences**:
   - Use Docker to ensure consistent environments
   - Document all environment variables
   - Test in environments that match production

3. **Integration Issues**:
   - Identify integration risks early
   - Schedule more frequent integration tests for high-risk areas
   - Have contingency plans for major integration issues

## Recommended Parallel Development Approach

To maximize parallel development while ensuring coherent integration:

1. **Start with Stub Implementations**:
   - Backend team implements API endpoints returning mock data
   - Frontend team implements API client with mock handling
   - DevOps team sets up basic Docker configuration

2. **Incremental Feature Development**:
   - Implement features in small, testable increments
   - Integrate and test each increment
   - Document any issues or changes needed

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Regularly merge and test changes
   - Automate testing where possible
   - Address integration issues immediately

By following these guidelines, the three teams can work in parallel while ensuring all components will fit coherently together.
