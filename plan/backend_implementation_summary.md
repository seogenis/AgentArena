# Backend Implementation Summary for Stage 6

## Overview

This document summarizes the Python backend implementation for Stage 6 of the AI Territory Control Game. The backend uses FastAPI and NVIDIA's AIQToolkit to enhance the game with more sophisticated agent behaviors and team strategies.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **FastAPI Application**

   - Added WebSocket support for real-time updates

2. **AIQToolkit Workflows**
   - Created team strategy generation workflow
   - Implemented agent creation and specialization workflow
   - Set up workflow configuration files in YAML format

3. **Data Models**
   - Defined Pydantic models for request/response validation
   - Created models for game state, team strategy, and agent specification
   - Implemented conversion between different team ID formats

4. **Service Layer**
   - Implemented strategy generation service
   - Created agent specification service
   - Added fallback mechanisms for when AIQToolkit fails

5. **Testing**
   - Set up test infrastructure with pytest
   - Created API endpoint tests
   - Implemented service layer tests

6. **Docker Support**
   - Created Dockerfile for the backend
   - Set up docker-compose.yml for orchestrating frontend and backend
   - Added environment variable management

## API Endpoints

### Team Strategy Endpoint

```
POST /api/team-strategy
```

Generates a team strategy based on the current game state.

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "team_id": "red",
  "territory_control": {"red": 45, "blue": 55},
  "resources": {
    "red": {"energy": 50, "materials": 30, "data": 20},
    "blue": {"energy": 40, "materials": 35, "data": 25}
  },
  "agents": {
    "red": [{"id": 1, "type": "collector", "health": 100, "x": 100, "y": 100}],
    "blue": [{"id": 2, "type": "explorer", "health": 90, "x": 200, "y": 200}]
  },
  "resource_distribution": {"energy": 10, "materials": 8, "data": 12}
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "strategy": "aggressive",
  "focus": "territory",
  "priorities": ["expand_territory", "attack_enemies", "collect_energy"],
  "description": "Aggressive expansion focusing on territory control and eliminating enemy agents."
}
```

### Agent Specification Endpoint

```
POST /api/agent-specification
```

Creates a specialized agent specification based on team needs.

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "team_id": "blue",
  "strategy": {
    "strategy": "defensive",
    "focus": "resources",
    "priorities": ["collect_energy", "defend_territory"]
  },
  "resources": {"energy": 40, "materials": 35, "data": 25},
  "current_agents": [
    {"type": "collector", "count": 3},
    {"type": "explorer", "count": 2}
  ]
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "role": "defender",
  "attributes": {
    "speed": 0.4,
    "health": 0.9,
    "attack": 0.6,
    "defense": 0.9,
    "carryCapacity": 0.2
  },
  "priority": "materials",
  "description": "Heavily armored defender specializing in protecting resource collectors."
}
```

## WebSocket Support

The backend implements a WebSocket endpoint for real-time game state updates:

```
ws://localhost:8000/ws/{client_id}
```

This allows the frontend to send game state updates and receive strategic directives in real-time.

## Fallback Mechanisms

The backend includes fallback mechanisms to ensure reliability:

1. When AIQToolkit fails to generate a team strategy, the system falls back to a basic strategy generation algorithm based on territory control.

2. When AIQToolkit fails to create an agent specification, the system falls back to a role-based template system that creates agents with predefined attributes.

## Docker Configuration

The backend includes Docker configuration for containerized deployment:

1. A Dockerfile for building the backend container.
2. A docker-compose.yml file for orchestrating both frontend and backend.
3. Environment variable management for API keys and configuration.

## Integration with Frontend

To integrate the backend with the frontend, the following steps are required:

1. Create a BackendAPIClient.js file in the frontend.
2. Modify LLMService.js to use the backend client with fallback behavior.
3. Update LLMSystem.js to display backend connection status.
4. Add UI enhancements for visualizing AIQToolkit-generated strategies.

Detailed integration instructions are provided in the INTEGRATION_HANDOFF.md document.

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Complete the integration with the JavaScript frontend.
2. **Enhanced Workflows**: Refine the AIQToolkit workflows for better strategies.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and optimize API calls.
4. **Advanced WebSocket Features**: Enhance WebSocket support for more sophisticated real-time updates.
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Add more tests for edge cases and integration scenarios.

## Conclusion

The Python backend implementation for Stage 6 is complete and ready for integration with the frontend. It provides enhanced agent behaviors and team strategies using NVIDIA's AIQToolkit, with fallback mechanisms for reliability and Docker support for containerized deployment.
